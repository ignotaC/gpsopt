INSTALLATION
For install you need to download smallsoft+ignotalib
Install script does that for you so all you do is run:

sh ./install.sh

You will be downloading stuff from git ( smallsoft + ignotalib ).
We need readNMEA program.

After that run program so it will set up directories it uses.

./gpsopt

USING THE PROGRAM

Program only optimilizes RMC nmea lines. So you need to
convert your GPS files to RMC nmea. Using for example gpsbabel.
You put your files to GPS_raw. 

Now for optimilization simply run 

./gpsopt

Every line that is NOT RMC gets removed.
Program checks if the line is correct. If check sum is wrong,
line gets removed.
Than it removes positions that are simply close while reading the the
gps file.
After that gpstree directory is created and positions are being saved.
If later position is close to existing position - it gets removed.
So NEVER remove the gpstree dir since it will start passing points that
should not appear - they would be in area of points allready showed up.

The final optimilized points will appear in GPS_uniq dir
Other dirs should be empty when program finishes.

If you put files from GPS_uniq to GPS_raw and run program.
Everythign will be removed because those positions are already saved
in gpstree and will be treated as repeated.

I advice to backup your data and experiment with program
to understand how it works.

Goodluck.
